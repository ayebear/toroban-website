			<h1>Toroban Demos</h1>
			<br />
			<h2>Demo 4</h2>
			<p>????</p>
			<p>
				Coming soon to Steam! This will be released along with the full
				game as a way to try part 1 of the tutorial for free.
			</p>
			<br />
			<h2>Demo 3</h2>
			<p>2021-03-05</p>
			<p>
				Multiple characters with unlocked movement, and reverted rule
				blocks - kept more of the traditional mechanics such as
				switches/gates, lasers, and mirrors. Other mechanics tweaks with
				the aim to be more intuitive. 56 fully solvable levels
				showcasing many of the mechanics that could make it into the
				final game.

			<h2>Demo 2</h2>
			<p>2020-06-24</p>
			<p>
				After some feedback was received from Demo 1, I made many
				changes, fixes, and design improvements. Players are no longer
				killed by water and light (maybe some future things like spikes
				will do this). Players were also redesigned to replace mirrors
				and wall blocks. Players can swim in water, and are able to push
				sand, allowing for lots of interesting and intuitive edge cases
				and mechanics.

			<h2>Demo 1</h2>
			<p>2020-04-14</p>
			<p>
				A new take on replacing life points. This version changes the
				concept of the player into a standard game entity, allowing for
				any number of players. Players have a color state. Added
				sand/water as the new terrains. Water and light "kill" players,
				turning them into ghosts. Ghosts can only interact with other
				ghosts. The other significant change in this version were the
				dynamic rule blocks. Whenever a rule block is hit with a beam of
				light, it changes the rules of all entities with the same color.

			<h2>Demo 0</h2>
			<p>2019-11-04</p>
			<p>
				Formerly known as "super secret demo". Features life points,
				colors, light beams, and bidirectional time travel. Condensed
				down the levels to just the more difficult and interesting ones.
				Breakthroughs were made with time travel, and it was working so
				well compared to the previous version of the game. I was finally
				able to continue making time travel levels. The four user inputs
				were introduced: undo/redo, rewind/un-rewind.
