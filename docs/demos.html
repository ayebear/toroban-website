				<h2>Demo 4 <span class="align-right">????-??-??</span></h2>
				<p>

					full game as a way to try part 1 of the tutorial for free.

				<h2>Demo 3 <span class="align-right">2021-03-05</span></h2>
				<p>
					Multiple characters with unlocked movement, and reverted
					rule blocks - kept more of the traditional mechanics such as
					switches/gates, lasers, and mirrors. Other mechanics tweaks
					with the aim to be more intuitive. 56 fully solvable levels
					showcasing many of the mechanics that could make it into the
					final game.

				<h2>Demo 2 <span class="align-right">2020-06-24</span></h2>
				<p>
					After some feedback was received from Demo 1, I made many
					changes, fixes, and design improvements. Players are no
					longer killed by water and light (maybe some future things
					like spikes will do this). Players were also redesigned to
					replace mirrors and wall blocks. Players can swim in water,
					and are able to push sand, allowing for lots of interesting
					and intuitive edge cases and mechanics.

				<h2>Demo 1 <span class="align-right">2020-04-14</span></h2>
				<p>
					A new take on replacing life points. This version changes
					the concept of the player into a standard game entity,
					allowing for any number of players. Players have a color
					state. Added sand/water as the new terrains. Water and light
					"kill" players, turning them into ghosts. Ghosts can only
					interact with other ghosts. The other significant change in
					this version were the dynamic rule blocks. Whenever a rule
					block is hit with a beam of light, it changes the rules of
					all entities with the same color.

				<h2>Demo 0 <span class="align-right">2019-11-04</span></h2>
				<p>
					Formerly known as "super secret demo". Features life points,
					colors, light beams, and bidirectional time travel.
					Condensed down the levels to just the more difficult and
					interesting ones. Breakthroughs were made with time travel,
					and it was working so well compared to the previous version
					of the game. I was finally able to continue making time
					travel levels. The four user inputs were introduced:
					undo/redo, rewind/un-rewind.
